# Candidate Symbols

This directory contains the symbols associated with each candidate in the voter website application. Each symbol is a visual representation that helps voters identify their preferred candidate during the voting process.

## Usage

- Ensure that each candidate has a unique symbol.
- Symbols should be in a standard image format (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
- The naming convention for the symbols should follow the format: `candidate_name_symbol.ext` (e.g., `john_doe_symbol.png`).

## Adding New Symbols

To add a new candidate symbol:

1. Place the image file in this directory.
2. Update the candidate list in the application to include the new symbol.
